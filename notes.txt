I'm learing beatifulSoup.
it's a package for pulling the data out of xml and html files.
we use bs4.
by default it uses html parser included in python, but we can other parsers too.
But how to parse a document? pass it to the constructor. You can pass in a string or an open filehandle.

(
    create a BeautifulSoup object: from a file:
        with open("index.html") as fp:
            soup = BeautifulSoup(fp)
)
(
    create a BeautifulSoup object: from a string:
        soup = BeautifulSoup("<html>data</html>")
)

Beautiful Soup transforms a complex HTML document into a complex tree of Python objects.
 But you’ll only ever have to deal with about four kinds of objects: Tag, NavigableString, BeautifulSoup,
  and Comment.
<------------------------------------Attention----------------------------------------------------------->

*****always remember to conver NavigableString to a normal pyhton string for memory usage*****

If you want to use a NavigableString outside of Beautiful Soup, you should call unicode() on it to turn it
 into a normal Python Unicode string. If you don’t, your string will carry around a reference to the entire
  Beautiful Soup parse tree, even when you’re done using Beautiful Soup. This is a big waste of memory.

  # Convert to a normal string
   text_content = str(nav_string)
